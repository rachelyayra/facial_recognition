# object-detectors
Welcome to the repository for object detection models that I've been working on! In this project, I've developed and fine-tuned several object detection models using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. These models are designed to accurately identify and locate objects within images or videos, making them highly useful for a wide range of computer vision tasks.
