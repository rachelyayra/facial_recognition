# Object Detection Programmes Repository

Welcome to the repository showcasing a collection of object detection programmes developed using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. 

# Files and Features

* Face Detector: Leveraging the power of the Dlib library, this model detects faces within image.

* Feature Extraction: A comprehensive end-to-end solution combining OpenCV and Dlib for robust face detection. The integration of these libraries offers a holistic approach to accurately identifying faces.

* Face Detector and Alignment: Building upon the face detection capabilities, this model incorporates alignment technologies to further enhance facial features after detecting faces in an image.
  
* Simple Image Classification Task: This feature showcases a straightforward yet effective image classification task. The model classifies images of cats and dogs based on their content, demonstrating the project's versatility beyond detection.
