# object-detectors
Welcome to the repository for object detection models that I've been working on! In this project, I've developed and fine-tuned several object detection models using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. These models are designed to accurately identify and locate objects within images or videos, making them highly useful for a wide range of computer vision tasks.

- Face dectector - Here, I used the Dlib library to detect the number of faces from an image.
- Feature Extraction - This is a full end-to-face detection program with OpenCV and Dlib.
- Face detector and alignment - In the file, after, I detect the number of faces in the photo, implemented some alignment technologies on the faces.
- Simple Image Classification Task-
