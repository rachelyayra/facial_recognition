# Object Detection Programmes Repository

Welcome to the repository showcasing a collection of object detection programmes developed using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. This project was undertaken in the month of November in order to help me get more comfortable with Computer Vision Tasks. 

# Files and Features

* Face Detector: Leveraging the power of the Dlib library, this model detects faces within image.

* Feature Extraction: A comprehensive end-to-end solution combining OpenCV and Dlib for robust face detection. The integration of these libraries offers a holistic approach to accurately identifying faces.

* Face Detector and Alignment: Building upon the face detection capabilities, this model incorporates alignment technologies to further enhance facial features after detecting faces in an image.
  
* Simple Image Classification Task: This feature showcases a straightforward yet effective image classification task. The model classifies images of cats and dogs based on their content, demonstrating the project's versatility beyond detection.
